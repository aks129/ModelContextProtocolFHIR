# FHIR R6 MCP Guardrail Patterns

Reference implementation of security and compliance patterns for AI agent access to
FHIR R6 data via Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**This is a runtime guardrail layer, not a knowledge skill.** It sits between any AI
agent and FHIR data (local or upstream), enforcing PHI redaction, audit trails,
step-up authorization, and tenant isolation on every request.

## When to Use This Skill

- You need to read, search, or write FHIR clinical resources through MCP
- You need PHI to be automatically redacted before the agent sees it
- You need an immutable audit trail of all agent access
- You need step-up authorization gates on write operations
- You need to evaluate R6 Permission resources for access control

## MCP Tools Available (10)

### Read Tools (no step-up required)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context.get` | Retrieve a pre-built context envelope with patient-centric resources |
| `fhir.read` | Read a single FHIR resource by type and ID (auto-redacted) |
| `fhir.search` | Search resources with patient, code, status, date filters |
| `fhir.validate` | Structural validation of a proposed resource |
| `fhir.stats` | Observation statistics: count, min, max, mean over valueQuantity |
| `fhir.lastn` | Most recent N observations per code |
| `fhir.permission_evaluate` | Evaluate R6 Permission for permit/deny with reasoning |
| `fhir.subscription_topics` | List available SubscriptionTopics |

### Write Tools (require step-up token)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fhir.propose_write` | Validate and preview a write without committing |
| `fhir.commit_write` | Commit a proposed write (requires X-Step-Up-Token) |

## Two-Phase Write Pattern

Writes always follow propose-then-commit:

1. **Propose**: Call `fhir.propose_write` with the resource and operation (create/update).
   This validates the resource and returns a preview. No data is changed.

2. **Review**: Check the proposal response:
   - `proposal_status: "ready"` means validation passed
   - `requires_human_confirmation: true` for clinical resource types
   - `requires_step_up: true` always for commits

3. **Commit**: Call `fhir.commit_write` with the same resource. Include:
   - `X-Step-Up-Token` header (HMAC-SHA256 signed, 5-minute TTL)
   - `X-Human-Confirmed: true` header for clinical resources

### Clinical Resource Types (require human-in-the-loop)

Observation, Condition, MedicationRequest, DiagnosticReport, AllergyIntolerance,
Procedure, CarePlan, Immunization, NutritionIntake, DeviceAlert.

## Supported FHIR Resource Types

Patient, Encounter, Observation, AuditEvent, Consent, Permission, SubscriptionTopic,
Subscription, NutritionIntake, NutritionProduct, DeviceAlert, DeviceAssociation,
Requirements, ActorDefinition.

### R6-Specific Resources

- **Permission** — Access control (separate from Consent). `$evaluate` operation.
- **DeviceAlert** — ISO/IEEE 11073 device alarms.
- **NutritionIntake** — Dietary consumption tracking.
- **DeviceAssociation, NutritionProduct, Requirements, ActorDefinition** — CRUD only.

## Security Guardrails (Always Active)

### PHI Redaction
Applied on every read path. Names truncated to initials, identifiers masked to
last 4 characters, addresses stripped to city/state/country, birth dates truncated
to year, photos removed, notes replaced with [Redacted].

### Audit Trail
Append-only AuditEvent records for every resource access. Database-level immutability.
Logs agent ID, tenant ID, resource accessed, and outcome.

### Step-Up Authorization
HMAC-SHA256 tokens with 128-bit nonce, 5-minute TTL, tenant binding.
Required for all write operations.

### Tenant Isolation
`X-Tenant-Id` header enforced on every query at the database layer.

## Search Parameters (Local Mode)

Supported: `patient` (reference), `code` (token), `status` (token),
`_lastUpdated` (date with ge/le/gt/lt prefix), `_count` (1-200),
`_sort` (_lastUpdated/-_lastUpdated), `_summary` (count).

Not supported in local mode: chaining, _include, _revinclude, modifiers.

In upstream proxy mode, all query parameters are forwarded to the upstream server.

## Setup

```bash
# Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d --build

# Manual
uv sync && python main.py &
cd services/agent-orchestrator && npm ci && npm start
```

Required environment variables:
- `STEP_UP_SECRET` — HMAC secret for step-up tokens

Optional:
- `FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL` — Connect to a real FHIR server (e.g., https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4)
- `FHIR_BASE_URL` — Backend URL (default: http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir)
- `MCP_PORT` — MCP server port (default: 3001)

## Known Limitations

- Local mode uses SQLite JSON blob storage (not indexed search)
- Structural validation only (no StructureDefinition or terminology binding)
- SubscriptionTopic stored but notifications not dispatched
- Human-in-the-loop is header-based, not cryptographic
- No historical versioning (version_id increments but old versions not retrievable)
- Upstream proxy: no response caching, no cross-version translation
